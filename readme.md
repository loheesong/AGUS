### The Project

Introducing Aim Gun Ultimate Shield, or A.G.U.S in short, our 2 player pong-inspired game. A.G.U.S is built using the Beta CPU datapath with slight modification. The actual game logic is done with Beta ISA. The game interface features a 30x15 LED screen, and 6 LEDs per player. Each player controls a paddle with 4 inputs (move left, move right, aim, shoot). Players must shoot balls at the opponentâ€™s goal to score while blocking incoming balls from the opponent. The winner is the player who scores 3 goals before your opponent does so.
